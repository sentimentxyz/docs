# Oracle

An instance of an oracle that is used to price a particular type of asset. We have created unique oracles for exotic assets such as Uniswap v2 LPs, aTokens, cTokens etc, which allow flexibility of what borrowers can use as collateral, enhancing the experience of building complex strategies.
