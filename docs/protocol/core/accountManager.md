# Account Manager

The Account Manager is the core contract which helps borrowers interact with
their accounts and in turn allows accounts to communicate with the rest of the
protocol contracts.

It is used by borrowers to create accounts, deposit assets, borrow against them,
delegate interactions to their accounts, repay outstanding debt, and close
their accounts.
