# Account Manager

## **Overview**

The `AccountManager.sol` contract will be responsible for 3 main things:

1. Minting and Initializing Accounts for Users (Borrowers)
2. Managing the state of Accounts with reference to: Availability of Accounts, initiating withdrawals and transfers between the User, Account and Lending Pool
3. Managing and updating data that Margin need to operate including; [Controller](protocol/controllers/controller.md) addresses and [Risk Engine](protocol/core/riskEngine.md) address.

## Contract Spec

### Storage

- `IRiskEngine public riskEngine` [Risk Engine](protocol/core/riskEngine.md) interface state variable. Stores the Risk engine contract
- `IControllerFacade public controller`  [Controller](protocol/controllers/controller.md) interface state variable.
- `IAccountFactory public accountFactory`  [Account Factory](protocol/controllers/accountFactory.md)
- `inactiveAccounts` an array of previously minted accounts that are eligible to be initialized for borrowers
- `isCollateralAllowed` a mapping of address to a boolean, affirming if a token address is able to be used as collateral

### Functions

#### Account Management

```solidity
function openAccount(address owner) external whenNotPaused { }
```

- This function queries `inactiveAccounts` array, if there are idle accounts, it will initialize the account making the borrower `address owner`  the owner, if there are no accounts available it will mint (create) an Account on behalf of a borrower, and initialize the borrower as the owner.

```solidity
function closeAccount(address _account) public onlyOwner(_account) { }
```

- function responsible for closing a specified account. To mitigate risks accounts can only be closed if it has no debt and Accounts can not be opened and closed in the same block.

**Account Functionality**

Account owners or operators do not control Accounts directly, rather the AccountManager manages functions on the borrowers' behalf.

- `deposit` : takes *Collateral* deposit requests from user, and passes the call and funds to the Account delineated in the parameters
- `withdraw` : withdraws **ONLY** collateral or profits from the Accounts. (Note: Users will never be able to withdraw Loaned Assets from the Accounts at any time.)
- `borrow` : processes borrow requests from user. The flow can be seen below
    - AccountManager pulls the`_amount` of a certain `_token` from the `Ltoken` contract
    - `LToken` transfers the requested assets to the Account
    - AccountManager updates the the state of the Account at the `_account` address
- `repay` Transfers a specified amount of token from the account to the LP

### Interacting with Controllers

Accounts interact with contracts external to the core Sentiment architecture via  [controllers](protocol/controllers/controller.md).

```solidity
function exec(
        address account,
        address target,
        uint amt,
        bytes calldata data
    )
        external
        onlyOwner(account)
    { }
```

- An Account Owner sends a call to the interaction controller via the `execute` function which checks :
    - `target` has a `controller` address associated with it, reverting if it false
    - `bytes calldata data` data Encoded function signature and parameters of the function to transact with in the target contract, are permissible
    - If all the checks pass the `exec` is called on the Account and an interaction is performed

## Liquidations

Liquidations will occur when the `healthFactor` of an Account falls below an acceptable level. This will signal to *maintainers* that the Account is at risk of default and should be liquidated. The liquidation process is handled by 3rd parties. Due to the complexity of Accountsâ€™ composition, i.e (Accounts can have multiple collateral types and loans from multiple pools) Liquidations will be akin to an OTC swap, whereby the *maintainer*  pays the loan(s) on the Account's behalf, and receives Margin Account's portfolio at a discount.

```solidity
function _liquidate(address _account) internal { }
```

- Liquidation function requires the caller `repay` all the debt outstanding
- Once the outstanding debt is paid on behalf of the `_account` the `sweepTo` function sends all the current assets in the `_account` to the caller.
