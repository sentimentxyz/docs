# Overview

The Sentiment protocol is a credit protocol that provides generalized margin
borrowing across DeFi. At its core, it allows borrowers to have access to
increased borrowing capacity and enables borrowers to deploy borrowed assets
in dynamic ways in a plethora of DeFi protocols. Simply put Sentiment
facilitates cross-margin that can be deployed across DeFi.

The two main actors in Sentiment are Lenders and Borrowers, value proposition
of both can be understood below.

## Sentiment for Lenders

For simplicity and ease of use, Sentiment's Ltoken contracts maintain a
simple mechanism: Lenders simply deposit any asset they wish to gain yield on,
and receive an interest-bearing token corresponding with their underlying asset.

## Sentiment for Borrowers

### Accounts
Accounts allow borrowers to margin their collateral and leverage greater
than 5x, and deploy borrowed assets across DeFi. Accounts are individual
smart contracts that resemble modified ds-proxys. For a borrower to
interact with the rest of the protocol, they must deposit collateral into an
Account. The normal borrowing flow will resemble the following:
1. Alice, supplies 10 ETH as collateral (effectively opening a margin Account).
2. Alice selects the type of Asset(s) they would like to borrow and the amount.
    * To borrow, Alice's Account will take a loan from the Lending Pool
3. Once Alice has the asset(s) in her Account, Alice may delegate the
interactions she would like to do with supported DeFi protocols. Let us assume
Alice wants to 10x Long ETH.
4. Alice may now interact with any whitelisted AMM, and use the asset(s) she
borrowed to exchange and purchase more ETH.
5. Once Alice is satisfied with her position, she re-purchases the assets she
borrowed, and repays her loan to the Lending Pool + any interest incurred. If
the trade went in Alice's favor she is able to withdraw her collateral and
profits.

### Interaction Controllers

To allow for dynamic capital allocation, Accounts are equipped with the
ability to delegate calls to Interaction Controllers. Interaction Controllers
are smart-contracts that allow Accounts to compute complex logic, such
as actions that borrowers want to execute with loaned assets including;
swapping on DEX, providing liquidity on DEX, earning yield on primitives such
as Yearn, Deposit into Money-Markets and much more.

### Risk Engine

The Risk Engine contract is 1/2 of the risk engine of the protocol. It
ensures all Accounts are adequately collateralized. It permissions
liquidations for Accounts that are at risk of being in default, and
stores the risk factor and health factor of each Account.
