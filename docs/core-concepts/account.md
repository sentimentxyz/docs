# Account

Sentiment employs the method of hypothecation, essentially allowing borrowers
to borrow capital >5x the value of their collateral in a way that mitigates the
risk of default for lenders. Accounts are dynamic and distributed asset
reserves that hold a borrowerâ€™s margin deposit and loaned assets that are
transferred when a debt position is created. Each Account represents a
single debt position. The core of how Sentiment's Accounts operate are
on the following premise:

## Delegated Ownership

The borrower never has custody of the loaned assets, i.e: loaned assets cannot
be transferred out of the margin vault. This delegated ownership model allows
the borrower to have control over how the funds are deployed without having
custody, thus passing the first right of ownership over these assets to the
protocol.

## Controlled Interaction

The protocol restricts the actions a borrower can perform with the loaned
assets to mitigate credit risk and maintain solvency. The allow-list for
these set of actions is configurable and can be modified through governance
mechanisms over time. The protocol can control what contracts (and which tokens)
the borrowed assets are allowed to interact with.

## Account Ownership

As mentioned before the Account will hold both the loaned assets and
the borrowers margin collateral. During the term of a loan, all assets within
the Account are controlled by the protocol and at no point will the
borrower be able to actually obtain custody of credited funds. The only
situation where a borrower would withdraw any assets from the vault is during
termination or reduction of the debt position.

## Control Flow

The typical Control flow of an Account would persist as follows:

1. Borrower pledges margin (collateral) to borrow assets.
2. Lending contract initiates credit transaction, sending assets to the
Account.
3. Borrower deploys the loaned assets in a controlled manner with the help of
the Controller.
4. The Risk Engine ensures health of the borrow account during the term of the
debt.

## Account Functions

All Accounts have the same actionable events such as (but not limited
to) purchasing assets, providing liquidity etc. The Sentiment Core team aims
to provide an augmentative interaction suite that scales as more opportunities
become available in DeFi.

Once a user opens a margined position, they will be able to delegate
instructions to the Controller. These actions will be verified
against the allowed list of possible interactions, if permissible, the action
will be deployed on the loaned assets. This implementation gives the borrower
the ability to determine the use of the proceeds, benefits from the increase
in value or profit of the funds while also protecting the lender from any
default risk.
