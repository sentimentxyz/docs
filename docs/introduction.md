# Introduction

Traditional Finance has robust credit markets supported by massive tech
infrastructure, insurance, and derivative mechanisms. Additional data collection
and reputation standards help mitigate credit risk by disincentivizing
borrowers from default via possible impact on their credit score affecting
future borrowing capacity. Together, this has allowed for the expansive growth
of under collateralized lending in TradFi over the years. While
disintermediation has been one of DeFiâ€™s strengths, it has prevented building
similar primitives for an under-collateralized credit market.

DeFi cannot fundamentally scale primitives due to inherent
capital inefficiencies, that impede sophisticated money managers, and degen
traders' ability to borrow capital to optimize opportunities. Sentiment
provides a primitive solution that; increases capital efficiency for borrowers,
allows holders of long-tail assets to gain sustainable yield and introduces
unique ways protocols can provide their users with increased exposure to their
respective primitives. The key proponent of Sentiment is the Margin Account, a
unique primitive that allows users to have access to greater leverage (>5x)
than incumbent money-markets, and allows borrowed funds to be deployed across
many DeFi protocols.
