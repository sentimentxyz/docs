Lenders supply assets to the protocol which are then lent out to borrowers as
undercollateralized debt. The value proposition for Lenders is straightforward - supply assets to
the protocol with the expectation to earn yields higher than those in current credit markets.

Lenders interact with the protocol by supplying assets and receiving corresponding
interest-bearing [LTokens](https://github.com) in return. These [LTokens](https://github.com) act as a receipt of deposit and can be burned
at a later point in time to redeem the initial principal and accrued interest.
